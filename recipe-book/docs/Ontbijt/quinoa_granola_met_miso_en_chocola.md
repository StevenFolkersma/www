![IMG_0471.jpeg](../../_resources/IMG_0471.jpeg)

## Ingredienten

- [ ] 2 tablespoons ground flaxseeds
- [ ] 50g dark (bittersweet) chocolate chips, plus extra to taste
- [ ] 65g coconut oil, melted
- [ ] 30g miso paste
- [ ] 120g rolled oats
- [ ] 30g tricolour quinoa
- [ ] 120g (4oz) unsalted mixed nuts (raw or toasted; I used hazelnuts, walnuts, pecans and cashews)
- [ ] 50g (1¾oz) mixed seeds (I used shelled hemp seeds, black and white sesame seeds and chic seeds)
- [ ] 20g (¾0z) raw cacao powder
- [ ] 100ml (3½fl oz/scant ½ cUp)
- [ ] maple syrup
- [ ] 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- [ ] Pinch of salt

## Bereiding

1. Preheat the oven to 180°C/160°C fan/350°F/Gas mark 4 and line a baking tray (pan) with baking parchment. In a small bowl, combine the flaxseed powder with 5 tablespoons water, mix well and set aside for 10 minutes while you prepare the other ingredients. With time it will form a slurry.
2. Put the chocolate and 1 tablespoon of the coconut oil into a microwave-safe container and melt in the microwave on medium in 20-second intervals, stirring in between each one to prevent burning. Once the chocolate has melted, add the miso paste and stir until combined. In a separate bowl, mix together the oats, quinoa, nuts, seeds and cacao powder.
3. Stir in the chocolate and miso mixture, then the flaxseed mixture, the remaining coconut oil, maple syrup, vanilla extract and salt. Mix until well combined. Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking tray and press it down evenly across the tray. It should be a thin and even layer, no thicker than 5mm (¼ inch) otherwise it won't crisp up properly.
4. Bake the granola in the oven for 40 minutes, then switch the oven to fan grill (broiler) and grill for 5-8 minutes until crispy. Do not mix the granola when baking, and keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn't burn, especially towards the end of the cooking time.
5. Turn off the oven and let the granola cool completely, undisturbed, for at least 45 minutes. Once completely cool, break the granola into uneven pieces with your hands, then mix in some more chocolate chips to taste and store in an airtight container.
6. Serve with plant-based yoghurt and fresh seasonal fruits or berries.
